## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to develop a Java application that efficiently searches for a specified keywords across multiple text files using multi-threading. 
On console we would have 3 options:
1. New Query
    - Input: String Query
    - Output: Query ID
2. Check result of Query
    - Input : Query ID
    - Output: List of {Line_i, Files_i} containing the search term
3. Exit

### Note: 
The search needs to be done in a multi threaded manner and the console should never be blocked.
